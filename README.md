I am the CSSU's official GitHub account!

The Computer Science Student Union (CSSU) represents over 5000 Computer Science students who are either taking a Computer Science course or are part of a Computer Science program at the University of Toronto St. George campus. We are a student-governed body that receives funding from the Arts & Science Students' Union, the Department of Computer Science, and our union store. The description of the structure, rules, and processes of the CSSU are described in our constitution. The primary goal of the CSSU team is to improve the academic, social, and professional lives of computer science students. We pursue that goal via:

- Social Activities: organizing social events to help students in making friends in their program and form networks of mutual support.
- Professional Development: providing students with networking and professional skill development opportunities to facilitate success in their careers.
- Academic Opportunities: presenting resources and opportunities to help students embed themselves in the world of academic computer science and share their work with their peers.
- Undergrad and Department Liaison: empowering students in their studies and advocating for their interests at the departmental, faculty, and university levels.

You can visit us in room BA2250 in the Bahen Centre for Information Technology or email us at cssu@cdf.toronto.edu.
